worldgen!!!!

Size in x, y counting sectors!!

world is generated as circle, with diameter equal to xy-size. outside of circle, there is straight fall towards infinity, and/or sea level.

World has maps to determine what it cont ains. Such maps are
  heightmap
  temperature
  influx of fluids
  outflux of fluids
  waterflux (in-out)
  evilness
  growth/vegetation

Air below altitude 0 becomes sea and/or lakes.
  temperature below 0 makes water freeze. water flux does not affect anything.
  vegetation determines type of scrubs etc.

temperature above 35
  water flux: high makes jungle. medium makes plain. negative makes deserts

etc..

heightmap determines initial height.
what determines the thickness of soil?
need a map to determine what kind of normal stone is to be placed where.
need a map to determine where to place special rocks
need a map to determine where to place veins of metal ore / valuable crystals

generate tile:
  find 'type of tile': air, ground/soil, rock, fluid
  air: air!
  ground/soil: determine what type of soil to place. sand, earth, mud, color of sand, etc
  rock: determine what rock
  fluid: determine what kind of fluid to place

geographic points of interest? volcaneos, rivers, streams, jungles?
